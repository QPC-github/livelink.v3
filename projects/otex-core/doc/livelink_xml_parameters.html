    supported. This value may be copied from the <code>servtype</code>
    parameter in the

    automatically.</td>

    <td>startDate</td>
    <td>The repository is traversed in modification date order,

    the indexing begins with items modified on or after the start
    date. Items with an earlier modification date will not be
    indexed.</td>

    as public documents. Public documents do not require
    authentication or authorization.
    <p class="note"><b>Note: This parameter bypasses Livelink
    security.</b> Items that are made public are shown in the search
    results without authentication or authorization. The content of
    these items is available through the "Cached" and "Text

  <tr>
    <td>excludedNodeTypes</td>
    <td>Specifies the node types that you want to exclude from
    indexing. Excluding a node type means that no items of that type
    are indexed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>excludedLocationNodes</td>
    <td>Specifies the IDs of the nodes that you want to exclude from

    complete URL for each item in the search results.</td>
    <td>The map contains keys that consist of comma-separated subtype
    integers, or the special string "default". These are mapped to a
    <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code> pattern. There are four

    <dd> The object ID.
    <dt> 1
    <dd> The volume ID.
    <dt> 2

    <td>A map of the display actions used in search results.
    Each subtype can have a different action.</td>
    <td>The map contains keys that consist of comma-separated subtype
    integers, or the special string "default". These are mapped to
    Livelink action names, such as "browse" or "overview". If the map
    contains an entry mapping "144" (documents) to "overview", and the
    Livelink server is version 9.2 SP1 or earlier, the "properties"
    action is used instead. The default value is a map with one

    <td>contentHandler</td>
    <td>The name of the <code>ContentHandler</code> implementation
    class to use when retrieving document content for indexing.</td>
    <td>There are four <code>ContentHandler</code> implementations:
    <dl>
    <dt><code>ByteArrayContentHandler</code>
    <dd> The fastest implementation, but not a very scalable one
    because it maintains the entire content in a byte array.
    <dt><code>FileContentHandler</code>
    <dd> Stores the content in a temporary file, but performs very
    badly for files larger than 10 MB.
    <dt><code>HttpURLContentHandler</code>
    <dd> Retrieves the content directly from the Livelink server using
    an <code>HttpURLConnection</code>. Performance is inexplicably
    disappointing, in line with but consistently 1-1/2 to 3 times slower
    than the others.
    <dt><code>PipedContentHandler</code>
    <dd> Uses a pipe to match the in-memory performance characteristics
    of the byte array handler without the scalability issues. Combines
    consistently good performance with small memory consumption.
    </dl>

    "com.google.enterprise.connector.otex.FileContentHandler"</td>

  <tr>
    <td>includedExtendedData</td>

    to construct the HTML content. Each subtype can have different
    attributes indexed.</td>
    <td>The map contains keys that consist of comma-separated subtype
    integers. The special string "default" is not supported. These are
    mapped to a comma-separate list of attribute names, which should
    appear in the ExtendedData field of the given subtypes. The
    default value is an empty map.</td>

    larger than this, the maximum size is used instead.

    <code>MaxItemsPerExtraction</code> parameter in the
    <code>[LivelinkExtractor]</code> section of the opentext.ini

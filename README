Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for Open Text Livelink!

The Google Enterprise connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.  
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

This Open Text Livelink Connector provides access to documents 
and document meta-data stored in the Livelink ECM developed by 
the Open Text Corporation.  

The Open Text Livelink Connector communicates with the Livelink 
Server using the Java language Livelink Application Programming 
Interface (LAPI).  To properly build this connector you will 
need access to certain components of the Open Text Livelink SDK,
specifically lapi.jar.  The Livelink SDK is a commercial product
offered by the Open Text Corporation and is not included in this
distribution.

Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Livelink!

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An
enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Connector for Livelink provides access to documents and document
metadata stored in the OpenText Content Server developed by the
OpenText Corporation.

The connector communicates with the OpenText Content Server using the
Java language Livelink Application Programming Interface (LAPI). To
properly build this connector you will need access to certain
components of the OpenText Content Server SDK, specifically lapi.jar.
The Content Server SDK is a commercial product offered by the
OpenText Corporation and is not included in this distribution.
